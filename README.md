### Project Title
Sales Data and Customer Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing sales data and customer subscription data to gain insights into revenue trends, customer behaviors, and regional performance. 

Sales Data includes transactional records for each order, detailing the products sold, order dates, quantities, unit prices, and revenues. This data helps us analyze product demand, sales patterns, and revenue generated per transaction.

Customer Data provides detailed information on customer profiles, including their names, subscription types, start and end dates, and revenue contributions. It also includes status updates for subscription cancellations and durations, allowing us to assess customer retention and subscription revenue streams.

Through this project, we aim to:
- Identify top-performing products and regions in terms of revenue.
- Understand customer subscription trends and cancellation rates.
- Develop visualizations that highlight key insights for business strategy, such as identifying potential high-value customer segments or regions for targeted marketing.
